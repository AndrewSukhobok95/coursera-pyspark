# Data Analysis Using pySpark

[Data Analysis Using Pyspark](https://www.coursera.org/projects/data-analysis-using-pyspark)


## Project-based Course Overview

Welcome to Data Analysis using Pyspark. This is a project-based course which should take approximately 2 hours to finish. Before diving into the project, please take a look at the course objectives and structure:

### Course Objectives

In this course, we are going to focus on 3 learning objectives:
- Learn how to setup the google colab for distributed data processing
- Learn applying different queries to your dataset to extract useful Information
- Learn how to visualize this information using matplotlib


One of the important topics that every data analyst should be familiar with is the distributed data processing Technologies. As a data analyst you should be able to apply different queries to your dataset to extract useful information out of it. but what if your data is so big that working with it on your local machine is not easy to be done. That is when the distributed data processing and Spark Technology will become handy. So in this project we are going to work with pyspark module in python and we are going to use google colab environment in order to apply some queries to the dataset we have related to lastfm website which is an online music service where users can listen to different songs. This dataset is containing two csv files listening.csv and genre.csv. Also we will learn how we can visualize our query results using matplotlib.   

### Course Structure

This course is divided into 3 parts:
- Course Overview: This introductory reading material.
- Data Analysis using Pyspark: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.
- Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.

### Project Structure
The hands on project on Data Analysis using Pyspark is divided into following tasks:

#### Task 1: Introduction
Understand the purpose of the project, the datasets that will be used, and the things we are going to learn at the end of this project.

#### Task 2: Importing first csv file of the dataset
Import listening.csv file, which contains data related to different users listened to different songs and prepare it for the analysis by dropping columns and deleting null values.

#### Task 3: Applying some Queries
Apply some queries to this dataset to extract useful information out of it. We will start from simple queries to more advanced. ones.

#### Task 4: Importing second csv file of the dataset
Importing genre.csv file and merge it with listening.csv to answer more advanced queries.

#### Task 5: Visualizing the query results
Learn how to visualize our query results using matplotlib.
