## Course Objectives

In this course, we are going to focus on seven learning objectives:
- LO1: By the end of Task 1, you will become familiar with the Jupyter notebook environment.
- LO2: By the end of Task 2, you will be able to initialize a Spark application.
- LO3: By the end of Task 3, you will be able to create Spark Resilient Distributed Datasets.
- LO4: By the end of Task 4, you will be able to create Spark Data Frames in several ways.
- LO5: By the end of Task 5, you will be able to explore data sets with Spark SQL.
- LO6: By the end of Task 6, you will be able to write statistic queries and compare Spark DataFrames.
- LO7: By the end of Task 7, you will be able to store DataFrames in Parquet tables.

By the end of this course, you will be able to initialize a Spark program, load datasets from a file, interact with the data using RDDs and DataFrames, and perform exploratory analysis using Spark SQL.

## Course Structure

This course is divided into 3 parts:
- Course Overview: This introductory reading material.
- Project "Explore stock prices using Spark SQL": This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.
